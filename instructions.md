# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Objective
The goal is to create a user interface (UI) for a company's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) software. The UI will provide:
1. Secure Single Sign-On (SSO)
2. An interactive chat interface
3. Document upload for processing
4. An analytics dashboard

This PRD outlines:
- The functional and non-functional requirements
- The recommended file structure
- Technical references and example code snippets from relevant libraries
- Guidance on how each feature can be integrated without delivering full production code

## 2. Scope
This UI will be used by **internal employees** and **stakeholders**. Core features include:
1. **Secure Login (SSO)**
2. **Chat Interface** for real-time RAG queries
3. **Document Upload** with progress monitoring
4. **Analytics Dashboard** with usage metrics

By consolidating all these capabilities, the system will **improve user productivity** and **centralize** RAG usage.

## 3. Key Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Login (SSO)
- **Purpose:** Provide secure, company-standard authentication.  
- **Requirements:**
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) integration (e.g., OAuth2, SAML, or OpenID Connect)
  - Role-based access control
  - **Success Criteria:**  
    - Users can sign in with their company credentials without creating a new password.  
    - Admins can manage user roles centrally.

> **Reference: NextAuth.js**  
> Documentation: [https://next-auth.js.org/](https://next-auth.js.org/)  
> **Example Snippet** (from NextAuth docs):
> ```ts
> // pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
> import NextAuth from "next-auth"
> import AzureADProvider from "next-auth/providers/azure-ad"
> 
> export default NextAuth({
>   providers: [
>     AzureADProvider({
>       clientId: process.env.AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID,
>       clientSecret: process.env.AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET,
>       tenantId: process.env.AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID,
>     }),
>   ],
>   callbacks: {
>     // Add role-based logic here if needed
>   }
> })
> ```
> This example shows how to configure an Azure AD provider for SSO.  
> Note: Adjust to whichever IdP (Auth0, SAML, etc.) your company uses.  

### 3.2 Chat Interface
- **Purpose:** Interact with the RAG system via conversational prompts.  
- **Requirements:**
  - Real-time messaging
  - Typing suggestions / auto-complete
  - Persistent chat history
  - **Success Criteria:**  
    - Users can ask free-text queries, and the interface returns RAG-augmented responses swiftly.  
    - Chat history persists (in session or database).

> **Reference: Example Chat Component**  
> A typical React structure might use a stateful component for chat messages:
> ```tsx
> // This is conceptual, not production code
> function ChatInterface() {
>   const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
>   const [input, setInput] = useState("");
> 
>   const handleSend = () => {
>     // Send query to RAG backend
>   }
> 
>   return (
>     <div>
>       {messages.map(msg => <MessageBubble data={msg} />)}
>       <input type="text" value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
>       <button onClick={handleSend}>Send</button>
>     </div>
>   )
> }
> ```
> In production, you would integrate with an actual RAG backend endpoint.  

### 3.3 Document Upload
- **Purpose:** Let users supply documents to the RAG system.  
- **Requirements:**
  - Drag-and-drop plus file selection
  - Multiple file format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
  - Upload progress indicators
  - Secure storage
  - **Success Criteria:**  
    - Files are successfully ingested by the RAG pipeline.  
    - Large files do not block the UI (asynchronous upload).

> **Reference: `react-dropzone`**  
> [Documentation](https://react-dropzone.js.org/)  
> **Example Snippet** (from official docs):
> ```js
> import {useDropzone} from 'react-dropzone'
> 
> function MyDropzone() {
>   const onDrop = acceptedFiles => {
>     // Handle file array
>   };
>   const {getRootProps, getInputProps} = useDropzone({onDrop});
> 
>   return (
>     <div {...getRootProps()}>
>       <input {...getInputProps()} />
>       <p>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</p>
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> ```
> This snippet shows the drag-and-drop approach used in a React component.  

### 3.4 Analytics Dashboard
- **Purpose:** Provide real-time usage metrics and insights.  
- **Requirements:**
  - Visualizations (charts, graphs, tables)
  - Key metrics (logins, uploads, query response times, engagement)
  - Data export (CSV, Excel, PDF)
  - **Success Criteria:**  
    - Admins can quickly identify usage trends.  
    - Data can be exported for further offline analysis.

> **Reference: Chart.js with React**  
> [Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)  
> **Example Snippet** (from official `react-chartjs-2` docs):
> ```tsx
> import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';
> 
> const data = {
>   labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
>   datasets: [
>     {
>       label: '# of Votes',
>       data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
>       backgroundColor: ['rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', ...],
>       // etc.
>     },
>   ],
> };
> 
> function AnalyticsChart() {
>   return <Bar data={data} />;
> }
> ```
> You can replace the static data with your real usage statistics from the RAG system.  

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. **SSO Integration**  
   - Must redirect unauthorized users to the login route.  
   - Must handle token refresh or session expiration gracefully.

2. **Chat Interaction**  
   - Must send user queries to the RAG backend and display responses in real time.  
   - Should provide typing suggestions or auto-complete, if possible.

3. **Document Upload**  
   - Must allow multiple files, show progress for each file.  
   - Must reject files exceeding the defined size limit (to be decided by admin config).

4. **Analytics**  
   - Must display usage data in real time or near-real time.  
   - Must allow data export (CSV, Excel, PDF).  

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Compatibility**  
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.  
   - Cross-browser support (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

2. **Performance**  
   - Load UI in under 2 seconds on average network conditions.  
   - Chat responses ideally returned within 2 seconds of user submission.

3. **Security**  
   - Enforce HTTPS.  
   - Adhere to GDPR/HIPAA compliance if applicable (PII must be protected).

4. **Usability**  
   - Provide tooltips, help icons, or inline instructions.  
   - Make chat input and file upload intuitive.

5. **Scalability**  
   - Support spikes in user traffic or document uploads.

6. **Reliability**  
   - Target uptime of 99.9%.

7. **Maintainability**  
   - Clearly separated components and minimal dependencies for easier updates.  

## 6. User Stories

1. **As a user**  
   I can log in with my corporate identity provider so I don't need a separate username/password.  
2. **As a user**  
   I can ask questions in the chat to quickly get context from the RAG system.  
3. **As a user**  
   I can upload documents by dragging them into the UI.  
4. **As an admin**  
   I can view usage metrics and export them for further analysis.  

## 7. Tech Stack

1. **Framework:** [Next.js 13 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)  
2. **Authentication:** [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs)  
3. **State Management:** (optional) [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) or [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)  
4. **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for utility-first styling  
5. **Charts:** [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) (with [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/))  
6. **Uploads:** Could use [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) or a simple `<input type="file" />` approach  
7. **Optional**: [Node.js Streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) or AWS S3 client if large-file uploads are needed.

## 8. Proposed File Structure

Below is a minimal **Next.js 13** project layout that keeps **file count** low while offering clarity:

```
my-rag-ui/
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── next.config.js
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js
├── .gitignore

└── app
    ├── layout.tsx
    ├── page.tsx
    ├── globals.css
    └── favicon.ico
```

### File/Folder Descriptions  
1. **README.md**  
   - High-level instructions for installation, running the dev server (`npm run dev`), and building for production (`npm run build`).  

2. **package.json / package-lock.json**  
   - Manages project dependencies (React, Next.js, Tailwind, etc.).  

3. **tsconfig.json**  
   - TypeScript configuration.  

4. **next.config.js**  
   - Next.js configuration, environment variables, custom settings.  

5. **postcss.config.js** & **tailwind.config.js**  
   - Tailwind setup for styling.  

6. **.gitignore**  
   - Ignores `node_modules`, build files, environment secrets.  

7. **app/layout.tsx**  
   - Root layout component. Shared structure (e.g., site header, navigation) across pages.  

8. **app/page.tsx**  
   - Default homepage that can conditionally render:
     - SSO/Login screen
     - Chat interface
     - Document upload
     - Analytics dashboard  
   - For clarity, you could break each feature into sub-components, but that increases file count.  

9. **app/globals.css**  
   - Global styles, Tailwind imports, or any custom CSS resets.  

10. **app/favicon.ico**  
    - Standard site icon.  

> **Note:** If more granularity is needed (e.g., an admin-only route for analytics, or an API route), you can add:
> - `app/api/analytics/route.ts`  
> - `app/analytics/page.tsx`  
> But the PRD objective is to keep file count **as minimal as possible** while still being maintainable.

## 9. Implementation Notes

1. **Authentication & Role Management**  
   - Use NextAuth's or Auth0's built-in session mechanisms.  
   - Store roles in JWT or a user profile object.  
   - Provide protected routes in Next.js using server-side checks or client-side hooks.

2. **Chat Integrations**  
   - Connect `page.tsx` to your RAG model's endpoint.  
   - Could use WebSockets or SSE for real-time streaming responses.

3. **Document Upload**  
   - Consider chunked uploads if file sizes can be large.  
   - Optionally, store file references in a database with metadata (e.g., user ID, upload time).

4. **Analytics**  
   - Capture events (logins, chat queries, document uploads) in a backend service.  
   - Provide an API route to retrieve aggregated data.  
   - Render the data in charts, tables, or graphs inside `page.tsx` (or a separate admin route).

5. **Performance & Caching**  
   - Use Next.js built-in optimization (Image Optimization, Code Splitting).  
   - For chat or analytics requests, consider caching responses if needed.

6. **Security & Compliance**  
   - HTTPS only.  
   - Keep sensitive user data encrypted.  
   - Follow your org's compliance standards for data storage and retention.

## 10. Example Developer Workflow

1. **Clone & Setup**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd my-rag-ui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Develop**  
   - Adjust `app/page.tsx` to handle **Login**.  
   - Set up your **Chat** calls to the RAG API.  
   - Implement **Document Upload** (e.g., using `react-dropzone`).  
   - Add **Analytics** chart in the same page or a sub-route.  

3. **Test**  
   - Write integration tests for each feature.  
   - Verify SSO flow with mock credentials or staging environment.

4. **Deploy**  
   - Run `npm run build` on a CI system.  
   - Deploy to Vercel or your internal hosting environment.
